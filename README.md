Network Monitor Agent (PHP)
This repository contains a simple PHP-based network monitoring agent designed to listen for and analyze incoming connections on specific common service ports (SSH, Telnet, FTP, SMTP). It logs connection details and flags potential suspicious activities based on basic heuristic rules.

Disclaimer: This agent is a basic demonstration for educational and conceptual purposes. It is NOT a production-ready Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and should not be used in sensitive environments without significant enhancements, robust error handling, and security hardening. Automated blocking based on simple heuristics can lead to false positives and service disruption.

Features
Port Monitoring: Listens on configurable ports (22, 23, 21, 25 by default) for incoming TCP connections.

Initial Data Analysis: Reads initial data from new connections to identify:

Absence of expected protocol banners.

Low ratio of printable characters (suggesting binary payloads).

Unusually long initial data (potential scan payloads).

Logging: Logs all connection events and detected suspicious activities to both standard output and a dedicated log file (network_monitor_agent.log).

Conceptual strace Integration: Provides guidance on how strace (a Linux utility) could be conceptually used for deeper system call analysis of processes handling suspicious connections.

Non-Blocking I/O: Uses socket_select to efficiently monitor multiple ports simultaneously without blocking.

Prerequisites
PHP 7.0 or higher with the sockets and pcntl (for signal handling) extensions enabled.

Linux environment (Crostini on ChromeOS Flex, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.).

sudo privileges to bind to privileged ports (ports < 1024).

Installation (Crostini/Debian-based Linux)
Ensure PHP and extensions are installed:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install php php-cli php-sockets php-pcntl

Clone this repository (or copy the network_monitor_agent.php file):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-monitor-agent-php.git
cd network-monitor-agent-php

Make the script executable (optional but good practice):

chmod +x network_monitor_agent.php

Usage
To run the agent, you need sudo privileges because it attempts to bind to ports below 1024 (e.g., port 22 for SSH).

sudo php network_monitor_agent.php

The agent will start logging to your console and to network_monitor_agent.log in the same directory.

Testing Incoming Connections
You can test the agent's detection capabilities from another terminal or another machine on the same network.

Normal Connections:

SSH: ssh your_agent_ip -p 22 (If an SSH server is running, the agent will see the banner exchange. If not, it will just see the connection attempt.)

Telnet: telnet your_agent_ip 23

FTP: ftp your_agent_ip 21

SMTP: telnet your_agent_ip 25

Simulated Suspicious Activity (e.g., "Non-Printable" Data):
You can send raw binary data or unprintable characters to trigger the MIN_PRINTABLE_RATIO_THRESHOLD heuristic.

echo -e '\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a' | nc your_agent_ip 22

nc your_agent_ip 21 then type random characters or paste binary data quickly.

Simulated Long Initial Data (e.g., for FTP/Telnet/SMTP):
You can pipe a very long string to mimic an unusual payload.

python -c "print('A' * 300)" | nc your_agent_ip 21

Conceptual strace Use for Forensics
If suspicious activity is detected, the agent logs conceptual advice on using strace. In a real scenario, after detecting an anomalous connection to, for example, your actual SSH server (not this agent's listener), you would:

Identify the Process ID (PID) of the service listening on that port (e.g., sshd for port 22):

sudo ss -tulpn | grep ':22'
# Or
sudo lsof -i :22

Attach strace to that PID to monitor its system calls (use -f to follow forks, -o to output to a file):

sudo strace -p <PID_of_service> -f -o /var/log/service_strace.log

Warning: strace can be intrusive and impact performance. Use with caution on production systems.
